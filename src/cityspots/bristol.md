Reasonably priced, unreasonably tasty burgers.

Good Italian food.

## Drink

## Spots

Live the Skin's life and check out the awesome view here.

#### [📍](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UStg2mXcXgCJr7fb6) 20th Century Flicks - Christmas Steps

#### [📍](https://maps.app.goo.gl/89HWARnKptAV4r2o8) The Last Bookshop - Park St

Unfortunately the £5 book shop (was £3 when I arrived in Bristol!) but still good value for money. They sell excess stock so you can find new books for a great price here.

Its SECRET! Easy to miss cafe with a lovely garden.

#### [📍](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yXerWNtgd6mTf3Jo9) Clifton Suspension Bridge - Clifton

The first thing that comes up when you look up 'Bristol things to do'. There for a good reason.

#### [📍](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a571aetYVNa4cQxM6) Leigh Woods 

Across the bridge are some nice woods to walk through. A nice route is to walk to the end and loop back alongside the Avon. Lots of cool art on the way.
