## Food


#### St Nicholas Market

Incredible streetfood selection. Every stall is a banger. Half of my placement wage went on rent in Bristol, this is where the other half went.

#### Squeezed - Wapping Wharf

Reasonably priced, unreasonably tasty burgers.

#### Moltobuono! - Park Street

Good Italian food.

## Drink

#### King Street - City Centre

Expensive but vibrant part of Bristol's nightlife. The Volunteer, Small Bar, Beer Emporium are all cool. The Apple at the end has ridiculously strong cider and a good waterfront view.

#### The Mother's Ruin

Cheap pub in city centre.

#### Motion

Infamous club in Bristol that hosts 'bigger' nights if that is your thing. Right next to the train station if you are passing by ;\)

#### Bag of Nails - Hotwells

Cosy cat pub. Small place that gets busy so I recommend going at a less common time.

## Spots

#### Cassie's Bench - Brandon Hill

Live the Skin's life and check out the awesome view here.

#### 20th Century Flicks - Christmas Steps

Cool spot to rent DVDs just like the old days. Hosts movie nights if you are keen and good place to get weird recommendations and/or you are looking for something hard to find.

#### The Last Bookshop - Park St

Unfortunately the £5 book shop (was £3 when I arrived in Bristol!) but still good value for money. They sell excess stock so you can find new books for a great price here. 

#### Secret Cafe - City Centre

Its SECRET! Easy to miss cafe that has a lovely garden.

#### Clifton Suspension Bridge - Clifton

The first thing that comes up when you look up 'Bristol things to do' but yes, if you are reading this and have not been... what are you doing?!

#### Leigh Woods 

Across the bridge are some nice woods to walk through. A nice route is to walk to the end and loop back alongside the Avon. Lots of cool art on the way.

#### Ashton Court

Grand estate with deer. Site of Bristol Balloon Festival.

#### University Botanic Gardens - Stoke Bishop

Well-kept botanical gardens which are a little out of the way but worth the trip. Free for students.

#### St Werburgh's City Farm

Cute farm and cuter animals.

#### Purdown

Goats and views, need I say more?

#### Severn Beach

Train makes this an easy day out, wouldn't pack any towels though.

#### Bristol Beacon

Concert hall in city centre. Allegedly where all the council tax went.

## Non-recommendations
Things I don't think are worth your time.

#### V-Shed - Harbourside

First ever Wetherspoons I've had to pay entry to go inside. Might as well have thrown that money into the water. Dancefloor opens on Saturday night.

#### Cabot Circus - Broadmead

A LEGO store is the only redeeming part of this place.

#### The Galleries
