title: Exeter

Exeter is my university city. It's small and you could probably see most of it in a day. It's location is great if you like getting outdoors being not far from the beach, Dartmoor and the rest of Devon and Cornwall.

## Food

#### eat the bird - Sidwell Street

Good chicken burgers.

## Drink

#### Timepiece - City Centre

The epicentre of Exeter's nightlife. Awesome hybrid of a pub / club. Snoop Dogg left $400,000 here allegedly. Bring a fiver in cash if you want to go upstairs.

#### Move - The Quay

Dingy club hosting suprisingly big names every so often. Drinks are very expensive but normally a good time and a good place to get away from very generic club music.

#### The Imperial - 'Impy' - St Davids

Allegedly the 2nd biggest Spoons in the entire UK. Worth a look with a quality beer garden which is a bit hilly.

#### Double Locks
A decent, but pleasant, walk down the quay leads you to this hidden away pub. Alternatively you can rent a canoe from saddles and paddles and you should have enough time for a pint.

#### Topsham Brewery
Amazing pub by the quay. A little expensive but cozy.

## Spots

#### The Quay
Classic summertime place to be. 

#### Antiques Centre - The Quay
Fun to look inside and the cafe attached to it is incredible on a sunny day.

#### Matford Centre Car Boot
Legendary

#### Northernhay Gardens
Nice spot to sit down for a bit on a sunny day.

#### Rougemount Gardens
Tucked away by Northernhay and a bit more decorative and covered.

#### Hoopern Valley - University

A pleasant walking area right next to the university. Always by you as a student but easy to miss.

#### Physics Building - University

Go to the top for a hidden study room with a view.
