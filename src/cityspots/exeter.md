## Eat

#### eat the bird - Sidwell Street

## Drink

#### Timepiece - City Centre

The epicentre of Exeter's nightlife. Awesome hybrid of a pub / club. Snoop Dogg left $400,000 here allegedly.

#### Move - The Quay

Dingy club hosting suprisingly big names every so often. Drinks are very expensive but a reliably good time.

#### The Imperial - 'Impy' - St Davids

Allegedly the 2nd biggest Spoons in the entire UK. Worth a look with a quality beer garden which is a bit hilly.

## Spots

#### Northernhay Gardens
Nice spot to sit down for a bit on a sunny day.

#### Rougemount Gardens
Tucked away by Northernhay and a bit more decorative and covered.

#### Hoopern Valley - University

Nice walk right next to the university. Right next to you as a student at all times but easy to miss.

#### Physics Building - University

Go to the top for a hidden study room with a view.
