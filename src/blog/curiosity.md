Curiosity, to me, is an urge to seek knowledge. It is an intrinsic drive to explore the world. I think that harnessing our curiosity is one of the best ways to make life more exciting and enjoyable.

Thinking back to when I was a child, unbridled curiosity motivated me so much. If you look around, you can imagine exactly what it feels to lick any surface. This is because your toddler self was very busy sticking its tongue onto anything and everything, finding out what it tasted like. 

What is key for me here is how pure that feeling used to be. As we get older, we pass judgements on ourselves and hold back because of fear of what others might think. But letting go of this and just allowing ourselves to look for answers to the questions that naturally arise within can help us find our inner child again.

A great place to do this is in conversation. I have always been curious about other people because I think humans are endlessly interesting. Learning about another person's story and their thoughts and feelings in a more deliberate way has really improved the quality of my relationships. Asking 'why?' more is a very easy thing to implement. This is great when you and your conversation partner have a lot of capacity to share and be vulnerable but is of course more difficult otherwise. But even in conversation (where two are needed to tango) you make it much easier by holding up your end first.

In my final year university project I investigated a formalised use of curiosity in Reinforcement Learning. If that doesn't mean a lot to you, the jist is that Reinforcement Learning incentivises agents with reward instead of explicitly telling them what to do. Think of training a dog to sit by giving it treats. It turns out this is a good way to teach complicated behaviour. Curiosity in Reinforcement Learning provides an additional reward signal which is self-generated by the agent. The way it works is the agent builds up a model of its environment and tries to predict what will happen as a result of its actions. The more wrong it is, the more reward it will receive. This pushes the agent towards areas of the environment where the dynamics are unfamiliar. 

An easier way to think about it is this. You are walking around town and see an alleyway you've never gone down before. You decide to investigate expecting to pop out to another street you've probably already walked down. But following this alleyway leads to a small little garden with a cozy corner to read some books and blooming flowers. Woah! You're brain lights up! That is curiosity in action.

But can curiosity go too far? What about 'curiosity killed the cat...'?  

Yes, I think so. That isn't too say it is inherently bad, but unrestrained curiosity can be somewhat neurotic. I would say it crosses the line when you are relentlessly trying to settle uncertainty instead of pursuing something out of pure interest. To be fair, in my experience it is fairly obvious when you are in a despairing curious state over a more whimsical one.

Technology and large tech firms have figured this out. In some cases intentionally, some less so. But with so much information within access its no surprise so many people can spend so long on the internet endlessly diving into rabbit holes of information. Gambling by scrolling. But that is a separate essay for another day.

Therefore I think that to make use of your curiosity and allow it to flourish, you should be giving space for your brain to observe the world and letting it guide you. So yes, sometimes in the form of that spontaneous impromptu Wikipedia deep research session, but also in our living breathing planet around us. I'm encouraging you to take a different route back on your way home from work / school. To talk to the somewhat unfamiliar but cool neighbour / classmate or to read up in a subject you've always been interested in but never gotten around to taking a longer look at. Keep things novel, that is the spice of life. More readily ask the questions that come to your head. 

The cool thing about life is there is no end to things to be curious about.
