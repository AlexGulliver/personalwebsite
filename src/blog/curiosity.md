Curiosity, to me, is an urge to seek knowledge. It is an intrinsic drive to explore the world. 
I think that harnessing our curiosity is one of the best ways to make life more exciting and enjoyable.

Thinking back to when I was a child, that unbridled curiosity was arguably my most important motivator. The key here for me is how pure that feeling was. As we get older we pass judgements or hold ourselves back because of fear of what others might think. But letting go of this and just allowing ourselves to look for answers to the questions that naturally arise to us.

One way to implement this is in conversation. I have always been curious about other people because I think humans are endlessly interesting. Learning another person's story and thoughts and feelings in a more deliberate way has really improved the quality of my relationships. This is great when you and your conversation partner have a lot of capacity to share and be vulnerable but is of course more difficult otherwise. 

So it seems to be about giving space for your natural desire to find out and then following through on this. Maybe you are walking around your city and see a street you've never walked down before, maybe you see a stranger doing some activity you don't know much about. Through following this signal 

In my final year university project I investigated a formalised use of curiosity in Reinforcement Learning (TODO: Link). The jist is that Reinforcement Learning incentivises agents with reward instead of explicitly telling them what to do. It turns out this is a viable way to teach agents complicated behaviour. Curiosity in Reinforcement Learning provides an additional reward signal which is self-generated by the agent. The way it works is the agent builds up a model of its environment and tries to predict what will happen as a result of its actions. The more wrong it is, the more reward it will receive. This pushes the agent towards areas of the environment where the dynamics are unfamiliar. 

An easier way to think about it is this. You are walking around town and see an alleyway you've never gone down before. You decide to investigate expecting to pop out to another street you've probably already walked down. But following this alleyway leads to a small little garden with a cozy corner to read some books and blooming flowers. Woah! You're brain lights up! That is curiosity in action.

The cool thing about life is there is no end to parts of our world we will never be familiar with. And we seem to enjoy doing that as humans.
