#### Offensively practical

I want to get the most practical car ever.

Offensively so.

Tacky foam on the doors to stop it damaging others.

More miles to the gallon than acceptable miles per hour on the road.

Windows you have to roll down with eggs on toast.

You can forget the touchscreens I want button and switches and dials.

And I don't want to worry about the size of my parking space.

As long as it goes forwards and backwards,

that is all I need.

I want to get the most practical car ever.
