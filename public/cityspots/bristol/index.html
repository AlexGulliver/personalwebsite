    <h1>Bristol</h1>
    <h2>Food</h2>
<h4>St Nicholas Market</h4>
<p>Incredible streetfood selection. Every stall is a banger. Half of my placement wage went on rent in Bristol, this is where the other half went.</p>
<h4>Squeezed - Wapping Wharf</h4>
<p>Reasonably priced, unreasonably tasty burgers.</p>
<h4>Moltobuono! - Park Street</h4>
<p>Good Italian food.</p>
<h2>Drink</h2>
<h4>King Street - City Centre</h4>
<p>Expensive but vibrant part of Bristol's nightlife. The Volunteer, Small Bar, Beer Emporium are all cool. The Apple at the end has ridiculously strong cider and a good waterfront view.</p>
<h4>The Mother's Ruin</h4>
<p>Cheap pub in city centre.</p>
<h4>Motion (RIP)</h4>
<p>Infamous club in Bristol that hosts 'bigger' nights if that is your thing. Right by Temple Meads.</p>
<h4>Bag of Nails - Hotwells</h4>
<p>Cosy cat pub. Small place that gets busy so recommend going at a less common time.</p>
<h2>Spots</h2>
<h4>Cassie's Bench - Brandon Hill</h4>
<p>Live the Skin's life and check out the awesome view here.</p>
<h4>20th Century Flicks - Christmas Steps</h4>
<p>Cool spot to rent DVDs just like the old days. Hosts movie nights if you are keen and good place to get unique recommendations or if you are looking for something hard to find.</p>
<h4>The Last Bookshop - Park St</h4>
<p>Unfortunately the £5 book shop (was £3 when I arrived in Bristol!) but still good value for money. They sell excess stock so you can find new books for a great price here.</p>
<h4>Secret Cafe - City Centre</h4>
<p>Its SECRET! Easy to miss cafe that has a lovely garden.</p>
<h4>Clifton Suspension Bridge - Clifton</h4>
<p>The first thing that comes up when you look up 'Bristol things to do'. There for a good reason.</p>
<h4>Leigh Woods</h4>
<p>Across the bridge are some nice woods to walk through. A nice route is to walk to the end and loop back alongside the Avon. Lots of cool art on the way.</p>
<h4>Ashton Court</h4>
<p>Grand estate with deer. Site of Bristol Balloon Festival, Love Saves the Day Festival.</p>
<h4>University Botanic Gardens - Stoke Bishop</h4>
<p>Well-kept botanical gardens which are a little out of the way but worth the trip. Free for students.</p>
<h4>St Werburgh's City Farm</h4>
<p>Cute farm and cuter animals.</p>
<h4>Purdown</h4>
<p>Goats and views, need I say more?</p>
<h4>Severn Beach</h4>
<p>Train makes this an easy day out, wouldn't pack any towels though.</p>
<h4>Bristol Beacon</h4>
<p>Concert hall.</p>
<h2>Non-recommendations</h2>
<p>Things I don't think are worth your time.</p>
<h4>V-Shed - Harbourside</h4>
<p>First ever Wetherspoons I've had to pay entry to go inside. Might as well have thrown that money into the water. Dancefloor opens on Saturday night.</p>
<h4>Cabot Circus - Broadmead</h4>
<p>A LEGO store is the only redeeming part of this place.</p>
<h4>The Galleries</h4>
