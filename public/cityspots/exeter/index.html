    <h1>Exeter</h1>
    <h2>Eat</h2>
<h4>eat the bird - Sidwell Street</h4>
<h2>Drink</h2>
<h4>Timepiece - City Centre</h4>
<p>The epicentre of Exeter's nightlife. Awesome hybrid of a pub / club. Snoop Dogg left $400,000 here allegedly.</p>
<h4>Move - The Quay</h4>
<p>Dingy club hosting suprisingly big names every so often. Drinks are very expensive but a reliably good time.</p>
<h4>The Imperial - 'Impy' - St Davids</h4>
<p>Allegedly the 2nd biggest Spoons in the entire UK. Worth a look with a quality beer garden which is a bit hilly.</p>
<h2>Spots</h2>
<h4>Northernhay Gardens</h4>
<p>Nice spot to sit down for a bit on a sunny day.</p>
<h4>Rougemount Gardens</h4>
<p>Tucked away by Northernhay and a bit more decorative and covered.</p>
<h4>Hoopern Valley - University</h4>
<p>Nice walk right next to the university. Right next to you as a student at all times but easy to miss.</p>
<h4>Physics Building - University</h4>
<p>Go to the top for a hidden study room with a view.</p>
