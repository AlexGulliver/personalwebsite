<h2 id="food" tabindex="-1">Food</h2>
<h4 id="eat-the-bird-sidwell-street" tabindex="-1">eat the bird - Sidwell Street</h4>
<p>Good chicken burgers.</p>
<h2 id="drink" tabindex="-1">Drink</h2>
<h4 id="timepiece-city-centre" tabindex="-1">Timepiece - City Centre</h4>
<p>The epicentre of Exeter's nightlife. Awesome hybrid of a pub / club. Snoop Dogg left $400,000 here allegedly. Bring a fiver in cash if you want to go upstairs.</p>
<h4 id="move-the-quay" tabindex="-1">Move - The Quay</h4>
<p>Dingy club hosting suprisingly big names every so often. Drinks are very expensive but normally a good time and a good place to get away from very generic club music.</p>
<h4 id="the-imperial-impy-st-davids" tabindex="-1">The Imperial - 'Impy' - St Davids</h4>
<p>Allegedly the 2nd biggest Spoons in the entire UK. Worth a look with a quality beer garden which is a bit hilly.</p>
<h4 id="double-locks" tabindex="-1">Double Locks</h4>
<p>A decent, but pleasant, walk down the quay leads you to this hidden away pub. Alternatively you can rent a canoe from saddles and paddles and you should have enough time for a pint.</p>
<h4 id="topsham-brewery" tabindex="-1">Topsham Brewery</h4>
<p>Amazing pub by the quay. A little expensive but cozy.</p>
<h2 id="spots" tabindex="-1">Spots</h2>
<h4 id="the-quay" tabindex="-1">The Quay</h4>
<p>Classic summertime place to be.</p>
<h4 id="antiques-centre-the-quay" tabindex="-1">Antiques Centre - The Quay</h4>
<p>Fun to look inside and the cafe attached to it is incredible on a sunny day.</p>
<h4 id="matford-centre-car-boot" tabindex="-1">Matford Centre Car Boot</h4>
<p>Legendary</p>
<h4 id="northernhay-gardens" tabindex="-1">Northernhay Gardens</h4>
<p>Nice spot to sit down for a bit on a sunny day.</p>
<h4 id="rougemount-gardens" tabindex="-1">Rougemount Gardens</h4>
<p>Tucked away by Northernhay and a bit more decorative and covered.</p>
<h4 id="hoopern-valley-university" tabindex="-1">Hoopern Valley - University</h4>
<p>A pleasant walking area right next to the university. Always by you as a student but easy to miss.</p>
<h4 id="physics-building-university" tabindex="-1">Physics Building - University</h4>
<p>Go to the top for a hidden study room with a view.</p>
<h2 id="daytrips" tabindex="-1">Daytrips</h2>
<h4 id="dartmoor" tabindex="-1">Dartmoor</h4>
<p>Good for walks.</p>
<h4 id="spitchwick-dartmoor" tabindex="-1">Spitchwick - Dartmoor</h4>
<p>Really nice spot for swimming and having a relaxing picnic in summer.</p>
<h4 id="exmouth" tabindex="-1">Exmouth</h4>
<p>Huge beach.</p>
<h4 id="dawlish-dawlish-warren" tabindex="-1">Dawlish / Dawlish Warren</h4>
<p>Another good beach option.</p>
<h4 id="cornwall" tabindex="-1">Cornwall</h4>
<p>More good beach options!</p>
