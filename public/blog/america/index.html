<p>I just spent 3 months in America working at a summer day camp in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Almost all the stereotypes are true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Big things: people, cars, buildings</li>
<li>Greasy food</li>
<li>Loud and crazy people</li>
<li>Obnoxious capitalism</li>
</ul>
<p>I really enjoyed my time there, its surreal to peer onto the other side of the one-way mirror. Going to NYC for the first time was one of the most surreal experiences of my entire life. I will never forget how awestruck I felt.</p>
<p>It is sad to see the direction the country is heading. There are so many great people and places that are losing so much to the recklessness of the new administration. The speed of this change in course scares me too. I think Donald Trump has shown how much the US relied on convention and tradition in politics for stability.</p>
<p>I hope to come back to a flourishing and less divided America one day but it looks like that may be a while away. For now I will remember some of the awesome larger-than-life people I met and hold onto fond memories of exploring NYC and Chicago.</p>
