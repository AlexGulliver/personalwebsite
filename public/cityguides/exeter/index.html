<h2>Eat</h2>
<h4>eat the bird - Sidwell Street</h4>
<h2>Drink</h2>
<h4>Timepiece - City Centre</h4>
<p>The epicentre of Exeter's nightlife. The most amazing hybrid of a pub / club I've ever been to.</p>
<h4>Move - The Quay</h4>
<p>Dingy club hosting suprisingly big names every so often. Expensive but had some of the best times here.</p>
<h4>The Imperial - 'Impy' - St Davids</h4>
<p>Allegedly the 2nd biggest Spoons in the entire UK. Worth a look with a nice beer garden, if you aren't on the hill.</p>
<h2>Spots</h2>
<h4>Northernhay Gardens</h4>
<p>Nice spot to sit down for a bit on a sunny day.</p>
<h4>Rougemount Gardens</h4>
<p>Tucked away by Northernhay and a bit more decorative and covered.</p>
<h4>Hoopern Valley - University</h4>
<p>Nice walk right next to the university. Right next to you as a student at all times but easy to miss.</p>
<h4>Physics Building - University</h4>
<p>Go to the top for a hidden study room with a view.</p>
