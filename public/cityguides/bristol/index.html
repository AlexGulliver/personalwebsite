<h2>Food</h2>
<h4>St Nicholas Market</h4>
<p>Half of my placement wage went on rent in Bristol, the other half probably went here.</p>
<h4>Squeezed - Wapping Wharf</h4>
<p>Reasonably priced, unreasonably tasty burgers.</p>
<h4>Moltobuono! - Park Street</h4>
<p>Tasty Italian food where some unfortunate couples attempting to have intimate, romantic dates upstairs were graced (or should I say interrupted) by my placement company's drunken work social crowd of 20 odd folk.</p>
<h2>Drink</h2>
<h4>King Street - City Centre</h4>
<p>Expensive but vibrant part of Bristol's nightlife. The Volunteer, Small Bar, Beer Emporium are all cool. The Apple at the end has ridiculously strong cider for the proper West Country experience.</p>
<h4>The Mother's Ruin</h4>
<p>Cheapest pub in city centre.</p>
<h4>Motion</h4>
<p>Right next to the train station if you are passing by ;)</p>
<h4>Bag of Nails - Hotwells</h4>
<p>Infamous cat pub. Really cosy spot that gets really busy so recommend going at an unusual time.</p>
<h2>Spots</h2>
<h4>Cassie's Bench - Brandon Hill</h4>
<p>Live the Skin's life and check out the awesome view here.</p>
<h4>20th Century Flicks - Christmas Steps</h4>
<p>Cool spot to rent DVDs just like the old days. Hosts movie nights if you are keen and good place to get weird recommendations or if you are looking for something hard to find.</p>
<h4>The Last Bookshop - Park St</h4>
<p>Unfortunately the £5 book shop (was £3 when I arrived in Bristol!) but still good value for money. Believe they sell excess stock so you can find new books for a great price here. Every book I've gotten from this place was great.</p>
<h4>Clifton Charity Shops</h4>
<p>If its not term time you will probably find some cool stuff.</p>
<h4>Secret Cafe - City Centre</h4>
<p>Its SECRET!</p>
<h4>Clifton Suspension Bridge - Clifton</h4>
<p>The first thing that comes up when you look up 'Bristol things to do' but yes, if you are reading this and have not been... what are you doing?!</p>
<h4>Leigh Woods</h4>
<p>Speaking of the bridge, if you walk across it there are some nice woods to wander through too.</p>
<h4>Ashton Court</h4>
<p>More walking! This time with deer!</p>
<h4>University Botanic Gardens - Stoke Bishop</h4>
<p>A little out the way but well worth it.</p>
<h4>St Werburgh's City Farm</h4>
<p>Cute farm and cuter animals.</p>
<h4>Purdown</h4>
<p>Goats and views, need I say more?</p>
<h4>Severn Beach</h4>
<p>Train makes this an easy day out, wouldn't pack any towels though.</p>
<h2>Non-recommendations</h2>
<p>Things I don't think are worth your time.</p>
<h4>V-Shed - Harbourside</h4>
<p>First ever Wetherspoons I've had to pay entry to go inside. Might as well have thrown that money into the water. Dancefloor opens on Saturday night.</p>
<h4>Cabot Circus - Broadmead</h4>
<p>A LEGO store is the only redeeming part of this place.</p>
<h4>The Galleries</h4>
