        <div id="content"><p>As a Generation Z Computer Science student, technology is my life.</p>
<p>Life before smartphones compared to life now seem a world apart. I remember playing games on my parent's Blackberrys, a novelty at the time and not exactly something you would spend your whole day doing. Slowly, people at school started to get smartphones. As the software and hardware got better, the amount of time we set aside to use these devices increased.</p>
<p>Today, it's odd to see people without their phones out. I don't have any particularly unique insight into the super addictive social media algorithms, or psychology of our usage but I can speak about how I feel about it.</p>
<p>To me, it is a conflict I'm weighing up more and more. I am just as guilty as others of spending long hours looking at my own phone.</p>
<p>For me, always having terrible phones, I would prefer to spend my time on my laptop / computer instead. Countless hours to Minecraft and Counter Strike among a few others.</p>
<p>Today, I still spend a considerable amount of time 'looking at screens' but there is one difference, it doesn't feel like I have much choice anymore.</p>
<p>For some things this is extremely convenient. Messaging friends, managing finances, various admin is all in one place.</p>
